### Hello!
My name is Andrew Massey, and I am a graduating senior (December 2020) from the School of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma. My time at OU has been
largely focused on networking and distributed systems as that is a favorite topic of mine, so you'll probably see mostly projects related to that.

Please feel free to email me if you have any questions!
